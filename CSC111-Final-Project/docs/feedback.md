### Prototype III - Feedback

Thanks for presenting at demo day! I hope you enjoyed seeing all the other projects and got some ideas for how to improve your own. 
Before you make your final submission, please remember to do the following:
- You must add your names and group name to every .py and .md file. 
- What did you complete for this sprint?
- A rubric (i.e., list of features and cool stuff) should be added.
- Now is the time to finish your doc strings.
- Finally, don't forget that your Project Video and Individual Project Reflection are both due on May 5th, 2022.

### Prototype I - Feedback

**Headers**:   
Make sure you have headers in all .md and .py files!

**Read Me**:   
Good start-- add a little more detail, probably about the features of your game? It's a little bit basic.

**Group Contract**:   
You have a really good/comprehensive group contract! Great work.

**Sprint Planning**:   
I would love to see a little more detail in the tasks broken down-- what specific features are you planning to implement for each prototype? The overall function belongs somewhere else, most likely, but this is a good place to put down what exact features you're looking to add. 

**Code/Program**:   
It seems like right now, you're getting thwarted by a weird call-- I would make sure all the little yellow lines disappear before moving on to fix things. I think you might have to import it directly in order for it to work (?), but look into it. Otherwise, it's a little hard for me to tell how it will look, but nothing looks wrong-- just that you haven't finished it yet, which is totally normal!

**Other Comments**: 
This is a great idea-- keep it up!
