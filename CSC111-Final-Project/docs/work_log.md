**Team Name**:  RNR
**Team Members**: Natali, Renee, Rachel T

## Group Contract
_Note: In the space provided below create a group contract with your team. This is where you discuss any norms and rules you want to establish so that everyone works well together._

**Participation**: As a group, we will meet in person to work on coding and tasks that need to be done to get to our final product. We will try to work on the project on our own time if we can not make it to a group meeting. Each group member will be able to add to the project in their own way but in the end the work must be of equal value. When programming we will make sure to all have a say in what is done as well as make sure that we contribute equally to the code.
_Note: all members must equal share the responsibility of programming (i.e., writing code) and other creative aspects (i.e., research about characters, questions, narratives). Each member must be able to explain ALL parts of the program at demo day and upon submission. If individuals do not participate in programming activities, they may receive a failing grade._

**Communication**: We agree to communicate with each other often with updates, times to meet, and if anything comes up to let each other know. If we are not able to do something or are stuck on a piece of code, we will be open about it and ask for help. We will continue to meet during some tutoring hours so that we can get immediate help if need be. We agree to be respond in no more than an hour and a half. 


**Meetings**: We agree to meet every week to update each other and come up with tasks that each person must do before the next meetings. We will meet during tutoring hours as well as times that we all have time outside of tutoring. Each person is meant to arrive on-time or communicate if they will be late. Each meeting will be around 1 to 2 hours depending on the amount of work that needs to be done.


**Conduct**: We agree to be up to date with the tasks that need to be done and come to each meeting prepared to speak on the work we have done. We will not bring each other down when it comes to working on code or working together in general. We will encourage each other to be creative and to show what we have learned from the classes. We will allow each person in the group to have a say and will not shut down ideas before understanding them.


**Conflict**: We agree to listen to each other and the ideas that arise. If we do not agree with somethign or we want to do something different from what someone else wants then we will talk through the best option. We will try not to be bias and think about a way to combine ideas if it can happen.


**Other**: We agree to have fun!

Time:  6:00pm-7:30pm

**Date**:  April 26, 2022
Time:  7:30pm-5:00am
Who:  Rachel, Natali , Renee
Notes:  Debugged the button class and tried to add the last features .Not succesful because we ran into more bugs. We got most of the code that we have to work. Realized we need a done button and an invalid input message. Debugged the code that makes the user be able to choose their own options of clothing which wasn't successful because they clothes aren't layering onto each other. 


**Date**:  May 1, 2022
Time:  7:30pm-11:00pm
Who:  Rachel, Natali , Renee
Notes:  We added a done button, an invalid input message and used the feedback to get the code, that alllows the clothes to layer, to work. Still having a few issues figuring out what to do after the invalid input message is shown. Added text that explains to the user how to layer the clothes on. 

**Date**:  May 2, 2022
Time:  7:30pm-12:00am
