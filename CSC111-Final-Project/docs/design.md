## Sprint Planning
### Prototype I


* Prompt with done option that presents final outfit
* Create a class
Our main goal for this project is to create a dress up game that will display outfits as well as clothing items that our user can play around with. As part of our game, we will be able to have the user choose from 5 different aesthetics that they could potentially go to. Once the aesthetic is picked we will present an avatar wearing the outfit. If the user likes it then yay the game is over. If not then they will be able to pick and choose between the different accessories and items that they want the avatar to wear. After they are done they will see the final outift and finish the game.
* Our goal for prototype 1 is to come up with a text version of our game. We will prompt the user to choose what aesthetic they want to go with and then because most of our project is going to be graphics we will just print out a line that says that the outfit is going to show. This first prototype will be fully text based.

### Prototype II

* write a list of tasks / features
* In this prototype we will begin to show a few of our graphics and make sure that they display on the window so that the user can see a part of how our aesthetics will look like. The main thing in this prototype will be the graphics and making sure that we start to come up with things to display. We will also be making the class that will be used in main. 
* other

### Prototype III
_Note: We recommend completing your project, in its entirety, by Prototype III. Then using the extra time to fix bugs that you find during demo day and incorporate other ideas._
* Since we didn't have a due date for prototype 2, then the things that were meant for prototype two are now put into prototype 3 as well. We created a class for buttons that will be used throughout the game. The buttons will be clicked so that the user can choose between the different clothing items and accessories for Alexis, our avatar. It will also be used for the done button once the user finishes with their look. We have a few functions that will be called in main so that we can show the outfits and items. Graphics are a priority in our game. We will fix the bugs in the class for buttons.


## User Personas

_Insert user personas activity from class here._
Demographic: Young child and teens who like to play games and have an interest in fashion. Specifically how to put outfits together. 

Victoria (age 11): 
Likes: pastel colors, loves to play dress up in real life, likes disney, go girls games
Dislikes: creative writing, reading, being bored
She will like this game because of it calls for users of her interests.

Nico (age 15):
Likes: magic, cars, being outside, technology, video games
Dislikes: people, math, candy
He will not like this game due to the fact that they prefer video games that have more action. They probably would not sit through a game that has them choose outfits.

Dislikes: bugs, cars, being over the top
She will definetly like this game because she likes girls go games which are basiaclly the same concept with their dress up games.
