# Smithie Dress Up Game

Once user hits run they are prompted to pick between 3 locations (school, gym, and party). There is an outfit for each location. They make their selection in the entry box in the window and then the coresponding outfit for the occasion is printed to the window on the avatar.  

The outfit is printed to the window where the user is then ask if they like the outfit. If they type yes into the entry box then the program will end. If they type no then the game will then allow them to edit the avatars outfit themselves. They can cycle through the different clothing options until they are happy with the outfit. When the user presses the done button the the program will end.  

##  Background 
Our program is meant to pay homage to the popular [dress up flash games](https://www.numuki.com/blog/nostalgic-games-for-girls-to-play-online/) of the early 2000s. 

The goal is to help people learn how to dress up for different occasions and serve as entertainment for those interested in fashion.

## Features 
* Utilizes entry boxes to get user input text from the window instead of the console.
* Utilizes a buttons class that gets the coordinates from a users click on the windows to determine if they clicked inside the button. This allows the user to make selections in the window and iterate through the different articles of clothing.

## Features 

## Files
* main.py
* docs
* images
* buttons.py
* graphics.py
* testsuite

## Bugs
* The code presents an error when we exist the code for invalid inputs. 
* We could not figure out how to make the clothes automatically layer itself in the correct format. So the user has to layer it correctly themselves.
